This is a master repository of all my PYTHIA files for pp collisions over this summer. The goal of my project was to investigate the impact of background on pp and heavy ion collisions. This is done via adding pileup to pp collisions to mimic the heavy ion underlying event (PYTHIA) and by running ANGANTYR. 

My primary observable is N-point energy correlators, particularly for N={2,3}. I plot these observables for several jet energies and track pT cuts, and investigate how to properly simulate these collisions to control for background subtraction.
